# Transitions between Executive Councils

The transfer of responsibilities to the incoming Executive Council (EC) includes [onboarding new members to EC processes](#onboarding-new-executive-council-members), [updating access to resources](#access-to-resources), and [selecting members to serve in specific roles](#transfer-of-member-responsibilities).

## Onboarding new Executive Council members

New (incoming) members (both Community-elected and Council-elected) are announced in late December/early January. The official term of office for incoming Executive Council (EC) members is February 1. We ask that incoming members attend the regularly scheduled EC meeting in January prior to taking office to learn how meetings operate, and to prepare for formal transfer of responsibility. Outgoing EC members are welcome to attend the February meeting to ensure knowledge transfer has been as complete as possible. 

The outgoing Chair and/or Vice Chair should meet with the incoming EC members and Executive Director in January to discuss the following key points:
* The general workflow of the EC 
  * monthly meetings
  * as-needed special meetings and yearly in-person meeting
  * asynchronous communications
* Where different types of information are stored
* Responsibilities and expectations for all EC members

## Access to resources

EC members have access to the following resources:
* Google Drive
* GitHub organizations, teams, and repositories
  * Organization: carpentries
    * Team: carpentries/executive-council
    * Repo: executive-council-info (public, this repository)
  * Repo: private (EC + staff)
    * Team: carpentries-ec/ec
    * Repo: EC + ED
    * Repo: EC only
* Mailing list (listserv)
* EC Google Calendar
 
Incoming EC members should be granted access to these resources in January. Outgoing members' access to these resources should be removed in February.

Additionally, The Carpentries' website includes [EC Members/Officers](http://static.carpentries.org/governance/) and should be updated. 

## Transfer of member responsibilities 

The following EC roles should be assigned at the February meeting (these require formal voting by EC members):
* Officer positions:
  * Chair
  * Vice Chair
  * Secretary
  * Treasurer
* Committee representatives (these may continue from previous terms as applicable):
  * 2 x 2 Committee representatives
  * CoC representative
  * Representatives to Community Initiatives (CI)
