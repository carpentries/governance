# The Carpentries Governance

This repository contains documentation on reporting and meetings for The Carpentries' governance and is intended to provide transparency in leadership to the Carpentries community.

The Carpentries Bylaws describe the composition and main responsibilities of our governance. Current and past members, including which members are officers, and contact information can be found on the [Governance page](https://carpentries.org/governance/) of the Carpentries website.

## Documentation
Documentation on the workings of the Executive Council can be found 
at [The Carpentries Handbook pages on The Executive Council](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/executive-council.html).

## Minutes for Meetings
Please see the [minutes folder](minutes/) for the meeting notes.  

## Motions
Motions from 2022-2023 are included in [meeting minutes](#minutes-for-meetings) as well as in a separate 
[rolling document containing all the motions](minutes/motions.md) since 2022. Until 2022, the motions were written in minutes and as issues on this repository.
