    * IMLS - delayed to enable funds to go directly to 501(c)3  
    * GREI - Funds will go directly to 501(c)3 - approved by Community Initiatives and will not need to pay to Community Initiatives  
      * Question  
        * During the dual period of being under Community Initiatives and moving into a 501(c)3 - are required to get approval from Community Initiatives to decide whether funds go to  
          * Any funding received for programmatic work taking place while we are still under fiscal sponsorship will have to be received through Community Initiatives and will have to pay overhead  
    * Sloan/Howard - signed paperwork and it will be due in the next five days or so.   
    * Totaled $599,000, but will receive some in 2024 and some in 2025  
    * Updated projection for Q4 has a significant decrease in income because some of the funds will be received in 2025

      * Mellong Glosario Supplemental ($89,000)  
      * Pending grant application for NSF POSE Phase II ($1.5 million)  
    * Increased efforts for membership outreach  
      * Shifted to reengaging previous members. Have produced $52K from these efforts  
      * Outreach for Collaborative Lesson Development Training  
      * Membership Model Task Force  
      * Annual GIving Campaign (last year brought in $13,500)  
      * Pursuing NSF Cyber funding  
    * Big thanks to Erin Becker for all of her efforts in funding  
    * Questions:  
      * Income for Q4 is lower than forecast, but SLoan/Howard money will be coming in. Does the current amount include the $90,000 from the Sloan/Howard  
        * Those funds are not included  
      * Erin, Kari, and John should check in about GREI. Kari has the information and will share it with John.   
        * A few subawards are through Sloan. They don’t require us to submit any new paperwork that says we are no longer with Community Initiatives. They have offered to give us a letter that says Sloan knows The Carpentries is no longer with Community Initiatives and it is okay for the money to be processed.   
      * Congrats to the team for working on these efforts! It has brought a change to the previous scenario that we were in.   
      * John has helped on many grants this year and has taken on a large part of the efforts  
        * We want to be very positive about our current opportunities. There is not a lot of wiggle room in our finances. Went through a lot of scenarios to find out what we can do with our finances. We do need to keep our eye on revenue generation, membership drives, grant opportunities, etc. We are not in the clear. The new Board’s responsibility should continue to be about revenue ideas, membership drives, etc. and supporting Kari and Erin in their efforts. Once we spin it will be up to us to make sure we are in a comfortable place.  
        * Our focus should be on generating money in our reserve for sustainability  
          * This is on the Board work plan for next year. We can’t have investment accounts as a fiscally sponsored project, but when we spin we will. The Board will have an opportunity to approve our investment strategy.  
        * Once we spin, the ability to garner more corporate support will add to unrestricted funds. The Board’s responsibility will be to figure out ways to find unrestricted funds.

### Review and Discussion of Strategic Plan Activities  - Kari L. Jordan 

* Highlights from the year  
* Goal 1: Building capacity to empower communities  
  * Recommendations from Membership Model  
    * Expand and diversify services  
    * Change name of program to align with our program - make it more clear that it is a partnership   
    * January - Erin will lead a team to implement

      * New website meets web accessibility standard, screen reader friendly  
      * Please give your feedback on these sites!  
* Goal 2 : Accessibility  
  * Glosario - has allowed us to engage with a large community in Ukraine  
    * Large number of contributions into our Glosario - have expanded The Carpentries reach  
  * Chan Zuckerberg - upscaling Instructors at HBCMUs  
* Goal 3: Growth and Professional Dev  
  * Increasing capacity of volunteers and making sure they have access to resources  
  * Core Team has received Professional Development opportunities as well  
    * Effective reprioritization - should we pause, pass on to another org, or persist  
      * Has helped think of goals for 2025  
* Goal 4: Curricula  
  * HPC community is in lesson incubation phase - soon will be a new lesson program (like Library Carpentry, Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry)  
  * New lessons for Library Carpentry  
  * Improved R lesson  
  * Director of Curriculum, Toby Hodges, pitched upscaling software engineers to receive funding  
* Goal 5  
  * Submit grant proposal to National Science Foundation for 1.5 million   
  * Spin date is Feb 1, 2025!!!  
* Goal 6  
  * Prepared resources the community can use to advocate on our behalf   
    * One pagers  
    * Ensuring Handbooks include accurate info  
    * Core Team @ in-person meetings to continue building community and collaboration  
  * Current strategic plan goes through 2025 - don't need one immediately. Some work has been done to draft the next iteration, which will be shared at the Board retreat next year. Still moving these goals forward through 2025.   
  * Questions:  
    * Timeline for the RSE proposal - Q1 2025 submit, Sloan rewards around March. The proposal would be about 18 mo to develop and then we would ask for additional time to polit the workshops  
    * How is this related to Software Sustainability Institute and Netherland eScience center and other orgs that have been working with RSE?  
      * Toby has been in touch with leaders from all of the orgs working with RSE. He has draft letters of collaboration from five orgs that will work with him to develop the curriculum.  
    * What is the timeline for the membership task force? Do you need anything from the board for approval of changes, etc?  
      * Pao sat on the taskforce and represented the Board. The first 2 quarters of the year will be spent deciding the logistics and the second half of the year will be the implementation. Don’t expect to see the fruit of the labor until the end of the year or 2026. Does not require formal approval from Board but Kari will ask for feedback, as well as anyone from member organizations.

### Standing Committee Reports - Committee Chairs 

* Audit Committee  
  * No meeting since last Board meeting - do need to review insurance. Waiting on providers to come up with proposals. WIll get together early in the new year to make sure it is suitable  
  * In order for the Carpentries to begin signing contracts under 501(c)3, we needed an insurance policy. A policy was signed today. Kari will share with the audit committee. We still have other policies we need to look into.   
  * Pending question: should we bond the Code of Conduct committee? Should they be included in an insurance policy? Will discuss in January 2025.

        * Know the Carpentries needs to exist and there are always conversations about The Carpentries at every meeting they attend  
      * Important to focus on priorities and fiscal responsibility when we are working on budget  
    * Reminder: any expenses over $50K threshold will need approval. Once this is approved we reserve the right to modify as needed as long as its under $50K  
    * Breaking point for becoming 501(c)3 was $1.4 million  
    * The money we were giving to Community Initiatives will be beneficial to our button line but may change as the team grows.

  * Maker: John Chodacki  
  * Second: Konrad Forstner  
  * Yes: 9 No: 0

### Recess

### Approve Revision to The Carpentries’ Mission Statement

* Large shift in the organisation and it is a great opportunity to take a look at the mission and vision and ensure it aligns with the communities vision  
  * Board gave feedback at last meeting  
  * Staff gave feedback about words that extend beyond British/English language and about making it more digestible  
  * Made sure it is still open - Board discussed the appropriate noun “open” should modify and the right “open” term to use and made slight edits to the proposed language.  
  * Suggestion that research and science are interchangeable  
    * Need to keep research because humanities are not considered science  
    * This difference is as strict in some languages/cultures  
* Motion: **I move to approve the proposed mission statement effective February 1, 2025.**
  * Maker: John Choacki  
  * Second: Eboni Dotson
