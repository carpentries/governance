## **Minutes Carpentries Executive Council meeting August 15, 2019**

### **19/49 Public Financial Reports**

Last time we were reviewing financial reports. Last time, we did not discuss what we are doing with the financial report or if people had requested access, so we wanted to have this discussion now. How much detail do we share publicly? We did create a public blog post with much of the financial information and break down and were planning to share the full report upon request.

### **19/50 In-person meeting update**

- Have applied for funding for the in-person meeting. The final proposal has been submitted to fund in-person meeting. The figure is around 14,000 USD.  For people who want some extra days to work before and after the core meeting days, it is possible to include such days in the schedule.

- We need to make sure that we make a final decision on the meeting in time for people who need a visa. Few People needs visa and flight booking and a letter of support for the visa that Tracy will do. Others do not need a visa. 

- Members will indicate whether they are available for extra days before and after the meeting.

  

### **19/51 Community Award**

We usually give these at the end of the year. We need to set the timeline and get a volunteer to write a blog post and collect names. There are nomination process forms for the community, staff and Executive Council. Then we check with people on the shortlist that they’re ok being nominated to receive the award. The nominations move forward with the people who were ok with receiving the award. We could give people the opportunity to opt-out rather than opt-in. The nominations will be open in November and selected in December.  We will have a time slot  during in-person meeting about the community award. Raniere and Josylnn will lead the award process.

 

### **19/52 Stanford ACT update/Strategic Planning**

Strategic planning is not accepted for this round of Stanford program. So, need another plan for generating Vision. We might need to have a task force to make our vision statement. Idea from Susan from Stanford ACT for creating Vision statement: get together representatives of all three Carpentries in a room with a paid facilitator to hash it out. They would represent all groups, and then what they decided would not be sent to the community for further review, it would be the decision. Background around Vision: In a standard leadership model, the responsibility of creating Vision and strategy lies with Executive Council and  it was a focus of 2018 in-person meeting. But because of our community-oriented organization, we wanted to get feedback from the community, so we put it out for comment. Got feedback where people had things to say about content (people who have these skills or people who teach these skills) and also around wording, and pithy phases didn’t really resonate, weren’t very vision-y. Also general confusion about mission and vision statements. Mission, how we do the work. Vision, the world we want to see. Went on for quite some time, then we waited once Stanford opportunity came up, to see if we could do that vision work with Stanford.  We should have a Vision statement in hand before in person meeting.  Real important decision point is around the content element. Is our vision around people who have these skills or people who teach/community build these skills. Our job at The Carpentries level, as the umbrella organization, is to have a higher vision for the whole thing, with individual lesson programs having their separate visions. So, Carpentries more about building community so lesson programs can build their set of skills. Already a higher level conversation that we’ve had in the past, so we seem more prepared

**Action item:** Karen and Kate working on putting together a plan for moving forward and Amy to review as requested.

### **19/53 Election planning  and Communications:**



- Members will read the EC Election Policy document and reported any problems they see with that

  

For nominations, no longer need to submit that initial blog post as a pull request. A google form instead, and it is the things that previously went in the blog post. There are two google forms for self-nomination and community nomination. The information from those forms is aggregated by Executive Council member and posted all at once as information about the candidates. We appreciate some feedback on them before starting the nomination. The post will include things  about the candidate like who they are and what they are doing in The Carpentries.  Channel on slack will be good for the election process this year.  We can also create a GitHub issue for the election process. If candidates create a 10-minute video that can be posted for the election process and remove later. There is a plan of action for both community elected and self election candidates.  We need to have a canonical place where all the google forms, google drive and Github issues links related to the election process.  The main link will be GitHub repo with google form that links to the GitHub too. 

We need to find a good way to get people for the Executive Council-elected position. It will require some work. We do have criteria/requests for people to serve on the Executive Council.
