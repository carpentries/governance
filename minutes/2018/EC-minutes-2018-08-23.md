* Remaining issues leading to proposals

    * Voting privilege for staff except Executive Director → Accepted. One comment was we should make sure voting will remain anonymous

    * Oversight of committees: new wording, Executive Council organises committees, Task Forces are formed by staff, staff oversees both, but both report to Executive Council when asked for. Accepted.

    * Soliciting nominations for appointed Executive Council members: bylaws specify community input requested, and an *election policy* describes how that occurs. No objections. We discussed policies in general, and who should be responsibility/accept them. It should be easier to change policies than bylaws.

    * Lesson program policy and Lesson Program Roadmap. We decided to set up a task force to complete drafts with Kate, Tracy, Amy.

    * Election policy, we decided to form a task force to complete drafts with Karen, Ethan, Tracy will ask Maneesha (she handles the logistics of voting)

    * This brought up the issue of how we (should) engage with membership organisations

    * Action point: Kate to wrap up, prepare and send out RFC for approval to Executive Council (aim to release next week)

**054/18 **Revisit timeline for elections document for Executive Council yearly timeline**

* Action point: Kate to coordinate work towards a timeline by September meeting

* Action point: we need to decide who of the appointed members will be up for election

**055/18 Mixing and matching lessons**

* Tracy proposes a task force. It is important to involve the Lesson Programs as for them branding is important. We discussed some candidates. Action point: Tracy to put together a task force. It would be good if the Task Force also discusses the respective requirements for their (Software/Data Carpentry workshop branding

**056/18 Update on Library Carpentry progress towards Lesson Program membership**

* Tracy provided an overview. There is a governance group, look at drafts of our policy and roadmap in their structuring, so well on their way. Some issues to address still

* There is a potential mutual benefit from Library Carpentry considering our draft texts that we should realise. By asking Library Carpentry for feedback on these texts and by checking how they are understood by Library Carpentry we can improve on the final versions.

* Lesson development is something where we feel we can provide help drawing from past experience

* Revenue stream is also an important point to consider

**057/18 Community awards**

* Executive Council is positive. Previously a blog post for soliciting nominations (September) and award, the Software Carpentry steering committee voted, announced (October) based on those

* We discussed whether organising this is in scope for the Executive Council in our role of Board of Directors. As a community governance group it is important to recognize our community. Role of staff in identifying candidates as they interact a lot with community.

* Action point: Raniere to set up blog post and coordinate responses leading to Executive Council vote

**058/18 Executive Director job plan and evaluation**

* Staff is doing evaluations and makes job-plans which are available to Executive Council.

* Action point: Ethan and Sue to evaluate the Executive Director per the process developed earlier for Data Carpentry
