### Minutes Carpentries Executive Council meeting June 15, 2021

* Present: Cedric Chambers, John Chodacki, Konrad FÃ¶rstner, Kari
  Jordan, Paula Andrea Martinez, Lex Nederbragt, Aleksandra Nenadic,
  Michael Smith, Sarah Stevens, Masami Yamaguchi
* Apologies: Sarah Stevens

#### 21/27 - Review and discussion of strategic plan activities

* Kari outlined how the repository for our [strategic plan
  activities](https://github.com/carpentries/strategic-plan/issues) is
  set-up. This includes the work we plan to do and how each activity
  maps to our [6 strategic
  goals](https://carpentries.org/strategic-plan/).
* Each team lead opened tickets. There are 26 open issues. These
  issues include status updates and the history for each. We will work
  to close these by next year.
* Next quarter (Q3): Several points are planned and key items to be
  addressed include the creation of the Equity Council (Sloan Grant)
  and accessibility upgrades.
* Final quarter (Q4): Focus on incubator program and continuing work
  on equity council
* The Executive Council should feel free to add comments directly to
  the issues.
* There exists an internal one-pager in Word and also a blog post that
  explains our current strategic plan efforts. Some of the strategic
  plan format configurations are due to the need to separate work to
  ensure that each github issue is about singular goals/issues (and
  not several). There is a column "Assignee" that shows the
  responsible people from the Core Team. Those are the people that can
  be contacted with questions about the specific plan activities.

#### 21/28 - Establishing the Values Alignment Task Force (Communications Committee - 10 minutes)

* The Communications Committee outlined the process that led to the
  establishment of the Values Alignment Task Force and the charter
  document that was drafted. The objective of this Task Force is to
  deliver a set of recommendations - a ['Due Diligence'
  process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_diligence) - for approval
  by the Executive Council on how to identify whether an organisation
  or service is acting in accordance with The Carpentries [Core
  Values](https://carpentries.org/values/). These recommendations are
  to be used as checkpoints to check that the existing relationships
  and service providers are conforming and to verify that The
  Carpentries can safely enter into new relationships with
  organisations in the future. This may include establishing a
  separate long-term Committee (for example, "Values Committee") to
  apply these recommendations.
* The Carpentries Operations Manager is prepared to lead the Core Task
  Force. Executiv Council member Aleks will represent the Executiv
  Council on the task force with the Treasurer as
  back-up). Additionally, several members of our broader Carpentries
  community were suggested to serve on the task force and will be
  contacted once the list is finalized.
* The deadline for generating a recommendation proposal is September.
  The Operations Manager is planning to schedule 2-3 meetings prior
  to September. Once current members have completed the preparation
  work, the task force meetings will focus ondrafting the final
  recommendations document.
* [Vote on
  motion](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/issues/64) -
  motion passed

#### 21/29 - Motion to Approve increase in FY2021 Annual Budget (Finance Committee)

* It was outlined that while our budget has been approved, that since
  then we have determined that some of the fees we pay have increased
  (approx \$7000 per month). So the Executive Council needs to vote on
  approving these added expenses. The Finance Committee recommends the
  approval of an adjustment.

* [Vote on
  motion](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/issues/63) -
  motion passed

#### 21/30 - Sponsored Instructor Training Proposal (Finance Committee)

* The purpose of this proposal is to outline how organisations can
  apply for fee waivers and then others would cover the cost of
  instructor training for them. During the June Executiv Council
  meeting, we determined that the Executiv Council was not needed to
  define the criteria; but is a task for the Core Team with advisement
  from the Executiv Council. Follow-up actions include understanding
  any requirements from a governance perspective needed regarding how
  to approve fee waivers.
* Potential instructors learn about The Carpentries in many different
  ways. Sometimes they move positions from active communities to new
  areas with a desire to grow the instructor community there. To
  support growth in new areas, they may ask for fee waivers. In
  support of this effort, The Carpentries might consider geographic
  priorities and support fee waivers in regions we desire the
  instructor community to grow. The Carpentries sponsors new
  instructor training to grow the global community, while these
  sponsored communities need long-term plans for sustainable growth.
  The metrics for sustainable growth first have to be defined -
  people are part of that process.. Sustainable growth also includes
  a focus on membership growth. Not just for financial goals.
* The "fee waivers" term may have multiple meanings within our
  community. There are fee waivers intended to support global
  economic disparities (e.g. Hardship, lack of equity, those
  intended for business development to grow paid membership. We have
  to be clear on which fee waivers we are discussing and provide a
  clear definition of each to the community at-large.

#### 21/31 Generative Discussion: Developing the Carpentries as an independent Non-Profit

* The Executive Director has set a goal to move The Carpentries to an
  independent non-profit, rather than a fiscally sponsored project
  of the non-profit Community Initiatives. This business structure
  would allow us to better achieve our strategic goals. In order to
  do this, we need a funding model that fits our goals/operations.
  One consideration is how we rely on grants. This needs to be
  re-aligned so membership revenue funds our operations (Core Team).
  Grants should fund grant activities, which may include programs,
  training, marketing and some operations functions. We have groups
  that would like to absorb The Carpentries, yet there is value to
  being an independent nonprofit organisation. An independent model
  could also help us to establish ourselves internationally.
* The Human Resources, Legal and Operations management of the
  organisation, currently handled by Community Initiatives can be a
  lot to handle. We would need to take these on, and may need to hire
  additional professional staff to support these functions. Our
  current fiscal sponsor, Community Initiatives, is supportive of our
  transition. They are willing to support our transition and, if we do
  not succeed in our application, are willing to continue as our
  fiscal sponsor. There are calculations needed to determine the costs
  to transition from the fiscal sponsor fees to organizational
  overhead. There will be pros/cons. One idea is to have a
  collaborative agreement with a university or other organization to
  help with benefits, overhead, salary, etc.
* The next step is to determine which jurisdiction we want to register
  in.
* Action item:
  * Executive Director to get these steps in writing to the Executive
    Council.
  * Executiv Council Chair: Ddiscuss this topic further with the
    Officers Committee.

#### Non-verbal updates

* Standing Committees: please remember to, at your next meeting,
  review your assigned issues and see whether there are some that
  could/should be delegated/closed because they are not falling under
  our responsibilities - as per our recent "Decision Making
  Transparency"
  [motion](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/issues/61).
  Report back to the Executive Council Chair so we can set up a new
  schedule for our monthly meetings.
