  Andrea Martinez, Aleksandra Nenadic, Michael Smith, Sarah Stevens,
  Masami Yamaguchi

* Apologies: Kari Jordan, Lex Nederbragt

* Guest: Erin Becker (Core Team)

### 21/32 Review voting methods for council-elected positions (Governance Committee, 5 minutes)

* The Governance Committee plans to create a motion for action on this
  item prior to the next Executive Council meeting.
* Executive Council members should expect to receive the motion in
  GitHub via email prior to the next meeting.

### 21/33 Update on Online Workshops (Erin, 20 minutes)

* Background information see [blog posts tagged online
  workshops](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-online-workshops)

* The Carpenries started online workshops when the COVID-19 pandemic
  began, committed to online workshops through the end of 2021.

* The Carpentries wants to continue with online workshops moving
  forward (indefinitely) as an option for participation (both online
  and in person). Pre-pandemic all workshops were implemented
  in-person.

* Workshop feedback forms have been reviewed and the metrics show high
  scores and participants and community members are still very
  interested in the workshops. Online workshops may provide more
  access to workshops for community members that are unable to attend
  in person.

* We want our online and in-person workshops to maintain their quality
  and be consistent in content presented. Want to consider a hybrid
  model for workshops as well.

* Community members are using our Carpentries guide for the
  accessibility of online events, so those are great resources. We
  have other resources that can be used to support online and hybrid
  workshop events.
  *  ACTION ITEM: Paula will send information to the Executive
     Council, Kari and Erin about contacts of people who have
     experience with hybrid workshops.

* There will be a need for people resources to support online
  workshops, as well as more administrative resources needed for
  organizing and implementation of online workshops.

* We do know that there are challenges with recruiting online
  instructors (fewer instructors are available to support online
  workshops). We want to ensure instructors get the same support and
  incentives for online instructions as for in-person instruction.

* One other resource needed for online instruction is "training"
  specific to online instruction. We need to investigate training that
  we can offer (ourselves or through a third party).

* In the future the EC may consider the option to require online
  instructors to have online instruction training certification prior
  to being allowed to teach workshops online. Also a peer review of
  instructional approach during the instructor training to ensure that
  online instructions are as robust and interactive as in-person could
  be considered. This could occur as a pre-workshop meeting to
  reinforce the methods.

* We can collect more data about the online environment via the
  post-workshop survey. A question can be added to the survey on the
  environment / managing an online interactive space, separated from
  the teaching method. Teaching online is definitely more demanding
  for the instructor. We should remain mindful that not all
  instructors will have the equipment resource needed to support
  optimal online instruction (monitors, computers, microphone, special
  room). This might be a reason for lower availability of instructors
  for online events.

* In the future the EC may consider the requirement for instructors to
  attend a community discussion on the topic of online training prior
  to being allowed to instruct.

### 21/34 Code of Conduct Committee Governance (Erin, 15 minutes)

* Blog post [Recruiting New Members to the Code of Conduct
  Committee](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/06/recruiting-for-coc-committee/)
* [Code of Conduct Facilitators
  Module](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/06/code-of-conduct-facilitators-module/)
* Low application response to Code of Conduct Committee recruitment so
  far
* Library Carpentries Advisory Group may be a resource for recruiting
  more Code of Conduct Committee committee members.
* The call for members has closed, but there is a plan to reopen to
  fill positions (3-4 members are needed)
* Code of Conduct Facilitators Module is currently open to the
  community for feedback.
* ACTION ITEM: All Executive Council members should reach out to the
  local community to support recruitment (and convince members to
  participate).

### Executive Council In-Person Meeting (Erin, 10 minutes)

* Discussion on approach to conducting an in-person joint incoming and
  outgoing Executive Council Meeting in 2022.
* New Executive Council takes office February 1st, thus it probably
  makes sense for the meeting to occur in January
* So far two in-person Executive Council transition meetings have
  taken place lasting two days, sometimes with an optional extra day.
* Determining a date for 2022 depends on pandemic status and member
  travel access (visas), etc.
* The Core Team supports planning (travel and logistics) for Executive
  Council meetings. The Executive Council plans their meeting agenda
  for the 3 days.
* Although the majority of Executive Council members prefer an
  in-person Executive Council meeting, we do not know if it will be
  practical for in-person in early 2022. More than likely, the
  Executive Council meeting will be virtual in early 2022 given the
  planning time needed and assurance of full Executive Council member
  participation (travel/pandemic).
