* Preliminary fundraising goals from Amanda Steele, Director of Fundraising 
    * August-December 2022: 
        * $5,000 from accessibility fund and also have a sponsor that is willing to match dollar for dollar
        * Sponsorship, securing the empowerment sponsor or a collection of sponsors that will reach the $150,000 mark
* Three-year plan for transitioning out of fiscal sponsorship will be discussed between Audrey Roderick (client services manager from Community Initiatives (CI)), Kari Jordan (Executive Director) and Erin Becker (Associate Director) to see how CI can support The Carpentries on its road to becoming an independent not-for-profit organization.


### Agenda item 22/18: CoC Committee Report



* CoC transparency report for 2022 by  the CoC Committee (CoCC) has been submitted for review by the Executive Council
* There were only three committee members during the pandemic but the committee now has five more members
* CoCC has written its Governance document which is now going to be reviewed by the new five members going to see if some of the roles need to be updated/revised
* Key discussions
    * How to handle CoC report involving someone from the Core Team (a Community Initiatives employee) or the Executive Council (not employed by Community Initiatives) 
    * Research ethics around indigenous data
    * Centering and basing the CoC around human rights rather than looking into laws and specific jurisdictions
    * Incident reports that aren't clearly CoC breaches - more work is needed on inclusion and understanding of different cultures as well as neurodiversity and providing training to people in these topics
    * How often is/should the CoC be revised


### Agenda item 22/19: The Carpentries Q2 2022 Financial Report



* Presented by Talisha Sutton-Kennedy, The Carpentries Operations Manager, for the period between 1 April - 30 June 2022
* Budgeted to bring a little over $200K in funding; brought in over double that ($460K)
    * Most came in from the Moore general support grant ($200K) - this is an unrestricted grant and can be used for any activity the Core Team deems fit
    * Also received $47K to support CarpentryCon 2022 conference, which was used to support accessibility, childcare, sign language interpreters and bolster the event
* Budgeted for $602K in expenses; came in a little under that
* The Core Team have brought in 63% of our total budgeted income so far and spent 50% of our projected expenses
* The actual balance at the time of the report is about $2.1M
    * Grant money: $142K, general funds $404K, reserve funds $293K


### Agenda item 22/20: Standing Committee Reports



* Officers Committee 
    * Executive Director succession planning - working on documentation for any future Executive Director  transitions; previously a transition checklist was created the Officers Committee is now adding some procedure documentation to supplement the checklist.
* Communications Committee
    * Discussion around communicating in languages other than English, especially during the time of the Executive Council elections
        * For example, candidates can provide videos about themselves in their native languages with subtitles in English or write blog posts in the language of choice which is then translated into English
        * The accessibility fund (used for CarpentryCon) can help support translations of the videos, captions, etc. 
    * Discussions were also had about which other Carpentries resources to translate - the Executive Council elections would be a great pilot for translations 
        * Transcription/translation of all materials makes sense as an international organization
        * How do we know the common languages, who should we translate for?
            * For larger communities (such as the Spanish speaking community) it would make sense to have a sustainable plan outside of the election campaign.
            * Biggest non-English sub-communities seem to use Spanish, Japanese, Swahili, French - but could also ask people to put in requests for other languages 
            * Translations will require a lot of work wo we should look to make this as easy and as automated, for example:
                * Using DeepL which has an API that generates a Pull Request out of text which can then be manually reviewed.
                * The Carpentries is also working on improving their documentation in English, e.g. by removing colloquialisms, etc., so that it is easier to translate.
            * The Core Team should look more into languages and communities that we should be supporting - e.g. based on their sizes or new communities we want to approach
* Governance Committee 
    * Parliamentary Procedures for Executive Council Meetings (intended to support decision made during meetings and making/amending/voting on official motions) have been approved
    * Bylaws revision are under way and will now happen on a per-need basis rather than every 2 years.
    * Working on the Executive Council Election Procedure for the upcoming [2023 Executive Council elections](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/09/ec-elections/)
* Finance Committee
    * Focused discussions on key questions for Community Initiatives regarding The Carpentries transition to independent non-profit organisation
* Program Committee - no new business to report


### Agenda item 22/21: Skills/Onboarding for Incoming Executive Council Members



* What expertise are we looking for in new Executive Council members? What skills do they need to have/learn - so we can update the on-boarding documentation?
* This discussion started as we needed to replace an Executive Council member Amel Ghouila midterm, but also trying to be more strategic when choosing new members at the next election. 
* The person replacing Amel would carry on for the remainder of Amel’s term, until February 2024 and we all need to think or suggest candidates that could be approached to take Amel’s seat. 
* Priority should be given to candidates with the expertise in the following areas: 
    * Auditing and finance
    * Compensation policy development
    * US nonprofit governance
    * Strategic planning
    * Representation from Curriculum Advisory Committees, Lesson Program Governance Committees
    * Understanding of how non-profit organisations in the US operate 
* Geo-diversity and location-wise: look at a region that we do not have an Executive Council member from (e.g. Southern/West Africa)
* For members of the Executive Council that are leaving at the end of this year, what skills do we think we’ll lose that might need replacing?


### Agenda item 22/22: Next Steps for the EC Retreat Items



* Marigold Strategy facilitated the Board Development section of The Carpentries Executive Council meeting on Monday July 18th (coaching on best practices related to board governance and structure and leading an organisation)
    * Recommendation and considerations from Marigold Strategy will be reviewed by the Officers Committee and decide on the next steps
* Fundraising - Finance Committee is to work with the Director of Finance to see how we can bolster fundraising and attract more donors, perhaps more research-based grants
* Program Committee to carry on working on onboarding documentation for the Executive Council and process development, as well as refreshing the curricula, making sure modules are up to date
