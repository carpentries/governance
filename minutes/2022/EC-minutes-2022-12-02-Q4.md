### Agenda Item 22/27: Executive Council’s Standing Committee Reports

* The  Executive Council Standing Committees reported on their activities for the last quarter
* Officers Committee
    * Worked on the Executive Director Succession Planning documentation and checklist for any future Executive Director transitions
    * Rearranged the standing committees structure for next year to make it fit more common board structures; one of the changes made was that the Executive Council will no longer have a Communication Committee and instead the publicity and comms will be facilitated by the Executive Council Secretary and the Core Team.
    * Worked on the Conflict of Interest Declaration form reported above
* Communications Committee
    * Worked on the multi-language support and the blog post and other social media about the 2023 Carpentries Executive Council Election (which was published in 4 languages - [English](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/09/ec-elections), [German](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/09/ec-elections_de/), [Spanish](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/09/ec-elections_es), [Japanese](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/09/ec-elections_ja)) 
* Governance Committee
    * Prepared for the 2023 Carpentries Executive Council Election
    * Worked on the high-priority Bylaws issues and updates: 
        * It was agreed that several portions of Bylaws will be removed and become separate policies to make it easier to update them (e.g. the Lesson Program Governance Policy) and certain parts will be adapted for the transition of the EC to the Board of directors (e.g. increase the number of the EC members)
        * It was agreed that, at this point, [voting eligibility for member organisations](https://github.com/carpentries/2022_Bylaw_revision/issues/2) will not be changed to give them voting rights because 1) member institutions host voting members and can influence the decision making process this way, and 2) regions that do not have as strong financial standing and cannot afford memberships would be discriminated against.
        * It was agreed to further work on expanding voting eligibility for [individual contributors](https://github.com/carpentries/2022_Bylaw_revision/issues/15) other than instructors which contribute in different ways (e.g. lessons developers, maintainers, translators, etc.)
* Finance Committee 
    * Worked on the FY23 Budget
* Program Committee 
    * Worked on updates to the Committee and Task Force definitions in Bylaws and their respective policies in the Handbook
    * The Executive Council approved the [proposed Committee and Task Force definition updates in Bylaws](https://github.com/carpentries/docs.carpentries.org/pull/814):
        * **Motion:** I move to approve the Bylaws updates on how committee and task forces are formed and the corresponding policy updates to the Handbook. 
          * **Maker:** Aleksandra Nenadic; **Second:** Konrad Förstner; **Voting:** motion passed (7 yes, 0 no, 0 abstain)

### Agenda Item 22/28: Updates from the Executive Director

* Fundraising - during December there will be an outreach fundraising campaign for unrestricted funds (that can be spent on any activities)
* The firm to help The Carpentries with the fiscal sponsorship transition (from a project under Community Initiatives to a full non-profit organization) has been identified 
* Performance review cycle: 
    * The performance review of the Executive Director has been performed by the  Executive Council Chair and  Executive Council Treasurer and the report will be shared with the rest of the Executive Council in due course
    * The Core Team also did a personal reflection and gave feedback for other Core Team members; they will work on plans for future growth for each Core Team member individually.
* Implementing the Lesson Program Governance Committees will be carried out in the first quarter of 2023, following the establishment/reactivation of Curriculum Advisory Committees for all official curricula in 2022 - to bring all three lesson programs in line with [the Lesson Program Governance Policy](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#lesson-program-governance-policy) approved by the EC in the late 2021 
* The new lesson infrastructure, The Carpentries Workbench, has entered beta testing with the community. Community members can stay up-to-date with the project by reading [the ongoing Dovetail series of blog posts](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-dovetail), written by the Lesson Infrastructure Developer, Zhian Kamvar.
* In collaboration with [the Academic Data Science Alliance](https://academicdatascience.org/), the Curriculum Team is piloting a project, called _Pointers_, that aims to build a curated and peer reviewed collection of open datasets for education. The motivation for building this collection is to provide curriculum developers and instructors with a choice of datasets that are well-suited for use in teaching, e.g. they strike a good balance in terms of size, complexity and authenticity, and are accompanied by good documentation and appropriate, open licensing. The Pointers collection will be hosted on Zenodo and reviews will take place on GitHub.


### Agenda Item 22/29: Planning for the Special Meeting wrt the Executive Council Elections 

* It was agreed that the special meeting to ratify the elections and the newly elected members and the new EC onboarding/offboarding documentation will be held on 14 December 2022
