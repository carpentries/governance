# 23/24 Standing Committee Reports 
## Governance Committee Report
- Discussing how the organisation will be run with concurrent Executive Council and Board of Directors
- Discussed scenarios after doing investigation with CxORE and Community Initiatives
- Understanding of the current obligation that we have to Community Initiatives as our sponsor
- Our governing body is complex
- Aren't required to structure governing committees and meet as often as we do
- Can streamline as we go forward to make things less complicated
- Discussed the future is the Board of Directors and the 501(c)3
- Proposition: Effective 1 February 2024, dissolve the Executive Council to synchronize terms with newly elected people. 
  Create a new structure 
- Fiscal sponsored project
- 3 person advisory committee required by Community Initiatives 
- 3 people who are not current Chair, treasurer, etc.
- Recommend Nisha, Konrad, and Yani
- Check in with Community Initiatives if they need to talk about Executive Director’s (Kari) performance or financial health of the org
- Represent The Carpentries fiscally sponsored project as we transition
- Once transition is complete, the advisory would be absolved
- Manages approval of assigned reimbursement requests, approves budget that is submitted to Community Initiatives, help with the transition agreement
- Reimbursements are approved monthly and the advisory committee only approves the Executive Director’s reimbursements, not the core teams
- Independent 501(c)3 organisation
- Board of Directors in place
- Continuing term Board and those confirmed in election
- Governing the activities of The Carpentries
- Use the bylaws of the 501(c)3 as the governing document
- Committee structure of the board would mirror the Executive Council - the finance committee on the Executive Council would move to the finance committee of the Board, etc. 
- Is the budget going to the board and Community Initiatives?
  Yes, it goes to both. Community Initiatives’ fiscal year is July. The Carpentries’ fiscal year is the calendar year. This helps them see how their money is dispersed across their projects
- The advisory committee will be the information bridge to Community Initiatives. The committee is the messenger, taking info from the Board to CI until we are no longer a fiscally sponsored project.
- Voting: I move to dissolve The Carpentries Executive Council on February 1, 2024, with governance responsibilities transferred to the new Board of Directors henceforth.
  Maker: John Chodacki, Second: Annajiat Alim Rasel
  The motion passed (In favor - 8, Against - 0)
- Voting: I move to appoint an Advisory Committee for The Carpentries, a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives, on February 1, 2024, consisting of Konrad Förstner, Nisha Ghatak, and Yanina Bellini Saibene.
  Maker: John Chodacki Second: Annajiat Alim Rasel
  The motion passes by consensus
- Voting: I move to extend the committee reports by 15 minutes
  Maker: Michael Smith  Second: Yani Bellini Saibene
  The motion passed (In favor - 8, Against - 0)
- Work with the team to make an announcement and comprehensive communication plan in 2024
- Executive Director will also have an open community meeting to talk about the updated governance process

## Finance Committee Report
- Year to date budget comparison: Income at 61%, Expenses at 82% of budget
- Overall Balance is slightly short, but we still have another month to go in the current quarter
- Compared to last year during Q3, our income is down and expenses are slightly up
- Led to some of the financial decisions made 
- Current overall balance covers operating expenses for 3.9 months
- Sustainability plan is to improve the financial situation by reducing staff and beginning outreach program

## Program Committee Report
- HPC incubation lesson program
- Rubric for reviewing official Carpentries policies
- Because of the transition to 501(c)3, a pause was put on this
- Conversations with Director of Curriculum (Toby) about having a detailed checklist for what a program should achieve during incubation phase to become part of the curriculum
- Not sure if it is sensible to do this with the size of the core team decreasing
- We do have a workflow to bring a lesson program online. It is a lot of work. Taking on a new lesson program is a concern at this point. 
- Program Committee talked about working with the Core Team to build a more comprehensive checklist. There are things missing. Will be more conversation about this with HPC/Core Team/Program Committee.
- Important to find the balance knowing that reduced staff means less capacity, while still supporting the community
