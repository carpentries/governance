## Minutes Carpentries Executive Council meeting September 23rd, 2020

Present: Joslynn, Elizabeth, Juan, Lex, Amy, Konrad, Kari, Cedric



### 20/45 Approve the Task Force Policy

*   Due to work on the Bylaws, we recently approved the Committee Policy. Next up is the Task Force Policy
*   Kari used the readme from the Task Force as a starting point: There are some questions we need to go through
*   Question 1 - Core team member involvement
    *   We discussed that it can be taxing on core team members if they are on all committees and task forces - but having a point person would be a good thing. How many task forces do we have and expect?
        *   2020: Carpentry Con
        *   2019 - Code of Conduct and Sponsorship, but these were not running at the same time.
        *   During the past 4 years ~ 1 - 2 task forces. As listed in the [Task Forces repo](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/master/README.md)
    *   Some felt staff involvement would be highly recommended
    *   It was suggested that Core team liaison can be available to take questions if needed, not expected to be in meetings unless explicitly asked for.
    *   Language around this will be updated in the document
*   Question 2 - Documentation public / internal
    *   It was agreed that documentation is internal by default, but be as open as possible.
    *   Language around this will be updated in the document
*   Question 3 - Timeline
    *   Should a timeline be included in terms of how long it would take to get a task force approved?
        *   It was suggested that working with the Executive Council chair would assist with a more accurate timeline
    *   Language around this will be updated in the document
*   [Motion: approving the Carpentries Task Force Policy](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/issues/44), motion passed.

### 20/46 Time zone challenges

*   It is challenging finding times for Executive Council meetings; good to have stretch times available in polls as well in order to share the time zone challenges
*   Can we get a longer-term solution? Fixed time/schedule for several months?
    *   We alternate this year due to more time zones
*   Alternating early/late is preferred by some rather than always meet in their stretch time
*   North America members are kindly asked to be more flexible
*   Proposal: use a A/B meetings system for the rest of the year; that means some alternate between comfortable and uncomfortable times

### 20/47 Financials update

*   We discussed Spreadsheet with budget and actuals
    *   When funding from grants comes in numbers balance out
        *   Illustrates dependence on grants
    *   1.5-2 months delay between payments and Community Initiatives processing these
    *   Core Team has own accounting in parallel
    *   Community Initiatives did ‘what-if’ exercise with grants no longer available; core mission would be sustained, but with much smaller team
    *   We will revisit finances in October to get full Q1-Q3 picture

### 20/48 Election update

*   We are a bit behind newly proposed timeline, but can catch up
*   Based on process, if Executive Council confirms election can be announced end of September minor confirmations needed
    *   Question - How many council elected positions will be needed
        *   3 council elected
    *   Question - specific skill - currently generally stated, specifics needed?
        *   Look at possible list of skills
    *   Not needed but helpful - email templates to be created for encouraging someone to self-nominate. Email asking if someone would accept a nomination for council-elected position
    *   Notification to relevant Core Team members that they might be getting questions about AMY records
*   Approve updated timeline:
    *   Original process, finish earlier but given this year it may be good to allow for more time for nominations
    *   October 1, 2020: nominations open (15 days earlier than usual)
    *   November 22, 2020: nominations close
    *   Late November: Blog posts and videos from candidates for community-elected positions are available to the community, confirmation emails for voting status sent
    *   November 30 - December 9, 2020: voting is open for community-elected positions
    *   December Executive Council Meeting - Executive Council votes on Council-elected candidates announcements soon after
    *   January: Executive Council announces 2020 Executive Council
*   Suggested to have email templates for encouraging someone to stand
*   Idea to reach out to previous nominees not elected to self-nominate again
*   Due to final’s week in US and holiday there suggested to keep voting open longer
    *   May make reaching December 15th deadline more difficult
    *   Decided to keep November 30 - December 9th

### Non-verbal updates

*   CoC worked on their governance document to clarify our roles as committee members; two different chairs are suggested - one for governance and one for incident response
