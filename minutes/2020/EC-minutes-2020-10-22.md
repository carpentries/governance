## Minutes Carpentries Executive Council meeting October 22, 2020


#### Revisiting the Overview of strategic plan roadmap

Discussion of the EC Specific Objective from the 2020-2025 Strategic
Plan and the topic to establish an Advisory Council for The
Carpentries that will meet biannually to advise the Executive Council
regarding strategic planning, finances, governance, and other relevant
topics. It should be 6 - 7 external members, inviting the EC to get
involved. So far 2 volunteers are available. The aim is to get people
with more background in board work. Planned are ~2 meetfings a year,
plus some other extras time.

Further notes regarding the Strategic Plan: The work on growth,
expansion and sustainability is not really represented in the
document. Suggestion to invite the Director of Instructor Training to
review this part. The plan will be further adaptive over the years.

#### Bylaws revision, second and final set of amendments

Motion for the second and final set of amendments. The bylaws revision
team proposes to close some of the other issues without any
amendments, and leave two smaller ones for the next EC.

#### Rubric for decision making transparency 

- As we are a consensus based organisation it sometimes can be hard to
  find out who made which decision - recommendation by consultancy
  company to clearly define who has which decision authority;
- Three levels: 
  - Vote 
  - Advise
  - Inform
- Action Item: Consult the Core Team to fill in information about the
  levels of authority via a form

#### Rubric for Public Statements

- Postponed - not enough information to discuss today

#### Who should the Carpentries align ourselves with?

- Start of the discussion in an GitHub issue about the question who
  The Carpentries should align with
- On question is if the EC should decide this
- Example: Hootsuit which we use but which now started a collaboration
  with ICE; Similar issues with GitHub;
- Which values do we look for in partnering with one organisation? It
  is tricky when we go and seek partners internationally.
- Similar question is coming up. Which kind of input does the EC have
  and how do we apply them in the decision making?
- We have the CoC that helps
- Suggested to have a Values/Ethics Committee (an extra group outside
  of the EC) to revisit issues from time to time and advise the EC and
  Core team about new partnerships. Not clear so far who will decide
  in the end.
- Suggestion: Task for the next EC (starting 20201)
