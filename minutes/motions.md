### Edits to language in the by-laws based on previous policy changes

[#861](https://github.com/carpentries/docs.carpentries.org/pull/861) - Updates the [Lesson Programs](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#lesson-programs) section of the bylaws  
 - Changes "Service to a particular audience of learners and instructors" to "Service to a particular audience of learners" (removes the words "and instructors" from the phrase)
