### Summary of Future Plans

In 2026, we will focus on strengthening organizational resilience and strategic alignment. Key priorities include identifying and assessing the top one to three organizational risks—financial, legal, and reputational—and escalating major themes to the Board. We will define targets and parameters for a board-level fundraising and resourcing goal, including cash and pro bono services, aligned with long-term financial sustainability priorities. The year will also include administering the 2026 Board of Directors Community Election. In addition, we will review the HPC Carpentry lesson program application and prepare a vote for Board approval, alongside a broader review of the curriculum portfolio to ensure alignment with our mission, values, and long-term goals.
