# The Carpentries Yearly Governance Report 

This folder contains a yearly summary of The Carpentries governance* activities.

The Carpentries is a fiscally sponsored project of [Community Initiatives](http://communityin.org/), a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit based in California, USA. The Carpentries is transitioning out of fiscal sponsorship to an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation ([learn more](https://carpentries.org/files/pdf/Fiscal_Sponsorship_Transition_FAQ.pdf)). For that reason, the organisation has two governing bodies.

Governance of The Carpentries (a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives) is undertaken by a three-person Advisory Committee. Governance of The Carpentries, Inc. (501(c)(3)  non-profit organisation) is undertaken by the Board of Directors. The Board comprises 11 persons, either members of The Carpentries community or from external communities brought in for specific expertise. At least one-third of the Board members are elected by the Carpentries community.

_*Before 2024, The Carpentries was governed by a nine-person Executive Council._
