# The Carpentries Yearly Governance Report 
*Reporting period: February 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024*

## Summary Statement
The Carpentries is formerly a fiscally sponsored project of [Community Initiatives](http://communityin.org/), a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit based in California, USA. Effective 1 February 2025, The Carpentries is an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation ([learn more](https://carpentries.org/files/pdf/Fiscal_Sponsorship_Transition_FAQ.pdf)). For that reason, the organisation had two governing bodies in 2024.

Governance of The Carpentries (a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives) was undertaken by a three-person Advisory Committee. Governance of The Carpentries, Inc. (501(c)(3)  non-profit organisation) was undertaken by the Board of Directors. The Board comprises 7-11 persons, either members of The Carpentries community or from external communities brought in for specific expertise. At least one-third of the Board members are elected by the Carpentries community.
