# The Carpentries Code of Conduct Transparency Report

2021-05-06

## Overview

### Reports

Between 2021-01-06 and 2021-05-04, the Code of Conduct committee processed one formal incident report. 

### Potential Code of Conduct Breaches

The Committee processed one formal incident report. The committee concluded that a breach of our Code of Conduct had occurred. As a result, a private reprimand was issued to the person that was reported.

### Summary of Police Matters

There were no police matters.

### Policy changes

- CoC incident reporting form (using Google Form) was set in Japanese to allow Japanese community members to submit their reports in their primary language. A current CoC committee member, Masami Yamaguchi (Executive Council Liaison) is a native Japanese speaker. She will translate reports submitted in Japanese for the committee and communicate with the reporter when needed.
- A pull request was made to add a sentence in the Enforcement manual to make a final meeting with the reportee a mandatory part of the procedure.
- A pull request was made to add a sentence in the CoC governance to emphasise the CoC committee operates independently of Executive Council.
 
### Committee changes

After concluding his role as a member of the Incident Response Group for the last incident report, Konrad FÃ¶rstner finished his term and stepped down from the committee as its previous Executive Council Liaison. This role has already been assumed by Masami Yamaguchi.

### Further relevant information

#### Recommendation for the communication norms

The CoC committee members (Malvika Sharan, Karen Cranston and Karin Lagesen) discussed how The Carpentries community members and staff can avoid assuming that The Carpentries community members can intuitively model our (mostly Western European / North American) communication norms. We have discussed this broader issue with the Executive Director of The Carpentries Dr. Kari Jordan to identify ways and set cultural norms regarding respectful community interactions, that goes beyond western or neurotypical communication styles that not all of our community members are accustomed to. The CoCc has recommended to Dr. Jordan that The Carpentries works on guidelines and processes that capture these aspects explicitly to share with the community.

#### Contribution to the CoC Facilitators Module

The Carpentries is developing a CoC facilitators module to train community volunteers who would like to help make the CoC reporting easier for their community events/platforms. The CoC committee members have been contributing to the development of this module, which is based on earlier drafts developed by Malvika Sharan and Karin Lagesen.
