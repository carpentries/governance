In June, the Code of Conduct committee hosted two community discussion sessions presenting the current status of Code of Conduct documents, the launch of the CoC facilitator module and projects/efforts the committee is currently involved in.
Specifically, a call for volunteers to join the committee was opened via this blog post: [Recruiting new members to the Code of Conduct Committee](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/06/recruiting-for-coc-committee/).
A short [YouTube video on The Carpentries channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hClP7TRcTMI) was also posted by the current chairs of the CoC committee to ensure that the interested candidates have an overview of the committee's work.
This call for application was extended and currently seeking suggestions of community members who can join to support and advance the work of the CoC committee.
