2023-01-13

## Overview

### Reports

Between 2022-07-30 and 2023-01-13, the Code of Conduct (CoC) committee processed NO formal incident report.

### Potential Code of Conduct Breaches

There was no report of an incident.

### Summary of Police Matters

There were no police matters.

### Policy changes

- A process flow diagram was added to the CoC main page: https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html#process-flow-diagram.
This is a flowchart sketched by CoC committee member Karin Lagesen for internal use by the committee, however, upon request, it was annotated by Malvika to share with The Carpentries Staff Maneesha Sane who added that in the policy document (details in issue: https://github.com/carpentries/docs.carpentries.org/issues/619).
- A minor update was made in the incident response document: https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/incident-response.html#checklists-for-responding-to-an-incident (details in issue: https://github.com/carpentries/docs.carpentries.org/pull/875).
 
### Committee changes

- Karen Cranston, the previous chair of governance stepped down after serving for several years on the CoC committee. She has contributed significantly to shaping and operationalising The Carpentries CoC and has been an extremely valuable member of the team. We thank her for her expertise, support and thoughtful service to The Carpentries community.
- Kari Jordan, Executive Director, who is the current CoC Staff Liaison, has onboarded Alycia Crall, Director of Community, to take over this role in the coming weeks.

### Further relevant information
 
- Previous chairs Malvika and Karen proposed the restructuring of the CoC committee to create more defined roles for the committee members. 
  - Upon agreement with other committee members, a survey and call for interest from within the committee were invited, following which a new set of roles will be assumed as listed below:
    - Incident Response Leads: Facilitate report handling, identify chairs and Incident response group, co-draft transparency report - D. Sarah Stamps, Lora Leligdon and Jonathan Stoneman
    - Training Leads: as part of regular business meetings - scenario curation, training/reading material accumulation, CoC facilitators program - Karin Lagesen and Yo Yehudi
    - Onboarding and discussion Leads: Onboarding/offboarding and discussion on topics that come up in incident response or other interactions such as communication and cultural diversity situations, Indigenous data sharing - Andrea SÃ¡nchez Tapia and Malvika Sharan
  - The previous governance document was edited by Malvika to record these updates, which is pending approval from the committee member.
  - Alycia Crall has scheduled the next meeting for a committee where we will discuss the operationalisation of these roles, the election of chairs and the finalisation of the governance document. 
- A separate draft was created by Malvika describing onboarding and offboarding processes -- information that can currently be found in the governance document: https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/coc-governance.html#onboarding-and-training.
