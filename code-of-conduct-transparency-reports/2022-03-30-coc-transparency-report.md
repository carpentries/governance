- Masami Yamaguchi stepped down, and Annajiat Alim Rasel joined as the CoC committee (CoCc) Liaison to the EC.
- Initially, Annajiat was invited to join the CoCc based on his application, however, upon his election 
to the Executive Council, and to further avoid any confusion regarding his role, this was a resolution agreed
upon by both the Code of Conduct committee and EC.

### Further relevant information

- One business meeting took place during this period to discuss CoCc plans for the year 2022 that included an addition 
of onboarding and offboarding process for the new CoCc members, possible update in the CoCc governance to allow 
more members to take on roles, potential review and update of CoCc for scenarios when organisation staff are involved 
or when the workshop's host organisation CoCs take precedent over The Carpentries CoC. A Pull Request is open for 
review and one related issue is open for discussion.
